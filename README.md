## About Darksaber

### A unique weapon, which is a black blade. The blade of the Darksaber is flat, thin, and curved, reminiscent of metal swords in shape, rather than the rounded shape of modern lightsabers. When activated, it emits a hum with a higher frequency than modern swords, and also makes sounds that resemble a whistle when swinging. The owner of the sword, who received it in battle, could claim the whole of all Mandalore planet.
